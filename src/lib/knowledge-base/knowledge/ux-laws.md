# UX Laws and Design Principles

## Hick's Law

**Source:** Hick's Law (1952)
**Category:** Decision Making
**Description:** The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices. Every additional choice increases the time required to make a decision logarithmically.

**Application:** Reduce the number of options presented to users at any given time. Use progressive disclosure to break complex tasks into smaller steps. Limit menu items, form fields, and navigation options.

**Example Violation:** A checkout page with 20 payment options, 15 shipping methods, and 10 discount code fields violates Hick's Law by overwhelming users with choices.

## Fitts' Law

**Source:** Fitts' Law (1954)
**Category:** Interaction Design
**Description:** The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target. Larger targets that are closer are easier to click/tap.

**Application:** Make interactive elements (buttons, links) large enough and place frequently used actions within easy reach. Touch targets should be at least 44x44 pixels. Increase spacing between clickable elements to prevent mis-clicks.

**Example Violation:** Tiny "X" close buttons in the corner of modals, or submit buttons that are too small for mobile devices violate Fitts' Law.

## Goal Gradient Effect

**Source:** Goal Gradient Hypothesis (1934)
**Category:** Motivation and Engagement
**Description:** People are more motivated to complete a task as they get closer to the goal. Progress indicators increase completion rates.

**Application:** Show progress bars, step indicators, and completion percentages. Break long forms into steps with visible progress. Use visual feedback to show users how close they are to completion.

**Example Violation:** A multi-step checkout process without progress indicators, or a long form with no indication of remaining fields violates the Goal Gradient Effect.

## Miller's Rule (7±2)

**Source:** George A. Miller (1956)
**Category:** Cognitive Load
**Description:** The average person can hold 7±2 items in working memory. Beyond this, cognitive load increases and performance degrades.

**Application:** Limit menu items to 5-9 options. Group related items. Use chunking to organize information. Break long lists into categories.

**Example Violation:** A navigation menu with 15 top-level items, or a dropdown with 20 ungrouped options violates Miller's Rule.

## Jakob's Law

**Source:** Jakob Nielsen (2000)
**Category:** User Expectations
**Description:** Users spend most of their time on other websites. They prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know.

**Application:** Follow established design patterns. Use common UI conventions (logo in top-left, search in header, shopping cart icon). Don't reinvent standard interactions.

**Example Violation:** Using a hamburger menu for desktop navigation when users expect a horizontal menu, or placing the logo in an unusual location violates Jakob's Law.

## Law of Proximity

**Source:** Gestalt Psychology (1920s)
**Category:** Visual Design
**Description:** Objects that are close together are perceived as related. Elements grouped together are seen as a unit.

**Application:** Group related form fields together. Use whitespace to separate unrelated content. Place labels close to their inputs. Group navigation items logically.

**Example Violation:** Form labels far from their inputs, or unrelated content grouped together without visual separation violates the Law of Proximity.

## Law of Common Region

**Source:** Gestalt Psychology
**Category:** Visual Design
**Description:** Elements within the same bounded region are perceived as grouped together.

**Application:** Use borders, backgrounds, or containers to group related elements. Cards and panels help users understand relationships between content.

**Example Violation:** Related content scattered across a page without visual grouping, or unrelated items in the same container violates the Law of Common Region.

## Aesthetic-Usability Effect

**Source:** Masaaki Kurosu and Kaori Kashimura (1995)
**Category:** Perception
**Description:** Users perceive aesthetically pleasing designs as more usable, even if they're not objectively better.

**Application:** Invest in visual design. Clean, modern interfaces build trust. Good aesthetics can compensate for minor usability issues in user perception.

**Example Violation:** Functionally correct but visually unappealing interfaces may be perceived as harder to use, even if they work well.

## Zeigarnik Effect

**Source:** Bluma Zeigarnik (1927)
**Category:** Memory and Completion
**Description:** People remember interrupted or incomplete tasks better than completed tasks. Unfinished tasks create mental tension.

**Application:** Show incomplete tasks or progress. Use checklists and to-do lists. Indicate what still needs to be done. Save drafts and show "in progress" states.

**Example Violation:** Not saving user progress, or not showing what steps remain in a multi-step process violates the Zeigarnik Effect.

## Peak-End Rule

**Source:** Daniel Kahneman (1993)
**Category:** User Experience
**Description:** People judge an experience largely based on how they felt at its peak (most intense point) and at its end, rather than the total sum of the experience.

**Application:** Ensure critical moments (purchases, sign-ups) are positive. End interactions on a high note. Make error messages helpful, not frustrating. Celebrate completions.

**Example Violation:** A great checkout process that ends with a confusing confirmation page, or a helpful app with a frustrating error message at a critical moment violates the Peak-End Rule.
